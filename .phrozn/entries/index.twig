          title: "Code Sherlock. Profiling PHP"
          description: |
              When there are performance issues, how do you find out what’s 
              wrong? It’s good when you know in advance what to look for, 
              but what if you don't? One of the solutions we employ at 
              HomeToGo is code profiling. It helps us to find performance 
              issues and improve our code. During my session at the 
              VilniusPHP meetup, we’ll review the best tools available for 
              code profiling in PHP. Some of them help identify a starting 
              point, while others dig deeper into a single method. We’ll 
              also try a proactive profiling technique that helps identify 
              problematic commits faster.
